The Knapsack Problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem commonly used to evaluate the performance of optimization algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms (GA). The problem can be succinctly described as follows:

### Problem Statement
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained in a knapsack of fixed carrying capacity.

### Mathematical Formulation
Let \( n \) be the number of items, indexed by \( i \), with \( w_i \) and \( v_i \) representing the weight and value of the \( i^{th} \) item, respectively. The knapsack has a maximum weight capacity \( W \). The objective is to maximize:

\[
\text{Objective Function: } \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i \times x_i
\]

Subject to the constraint:

\[
\text{Constraint: } \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times x_i \leq W
\]

Here, \( x_i \) is a binary variable that is 1 if the \( i^{th} \) item is included in the knapsack and 0 otherwise.

### Complexity
The Knapsack Problem is an NP-hard problem, indicating that the computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of items.

### Solution Approaches
1. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: In GA, a solution to the Knapsack Problem is represented as a chromosome, which is a binary string of length \( n \). Each bit in the string indicates whether the corresponding item is included in the knapsack or not. GA employs operations like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better solutions over generations.

### Applications
The Knapsack Problem has various real-world applications, including resource allocation, budgeting, and project selection, making it a subject of extensive study in optimization research.
